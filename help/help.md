# How to Play BreakPong

<br>

## Controls

BreakPong is a two player game that is a combination between
two classic videogames: Breakout and Pong. 

To play BreakPong, two players use one keyboard to each control
their own paddle. The top paddle (Player One) is controlled
using `A` to move left and `D` to move right. The bottom paddle
(Player Two) uses the `←` and `→` arrow keys to move left and
right, respectively. Each player must move their paddle to
hit any balls coming their way, since missing a ball will
make that player lose score.

To pause the game at any time, press `Esc`.

## Scoring

Each player starts with a score of **0**. If player hits a block
with a ball, they will gain **1** score. If a player misses
a ball and the ball hits the bottom or top edge (referred to as
a Goal), the respective player will lose **1** score (if a ball 
hits the top goal, Player One loses 1 score; if a ball hits the
bottom, Player Two loses 1 score).

The game ends once one player reaches **0** score. As soon as
a player loses their last score, the other player wins.

As the game progresses, the speed of the ball increases. The 
longer the players survive, the harder it will be to avoid
losing score.

When a ball hits either goal, a new ball will spawn on the side
of the opposite player (whichever player did *not* lose a score).

## Strategy

There are several styles of strategy for BreakPong, but a
few suggestions are:

* Focus on hitting as many blocks as possible to get a high
starting score with the goal of outlasting your opponent.
* Make a small crack in the blocks that extends to the
opponent's side to overwhelm them early on and try to win as
fast as possible.
